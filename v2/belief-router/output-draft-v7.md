# Output Draft v7 — Time-Aware + Asymmetric Framing + Tonal Adjustments

## What changed from v6

### 1. Time-aware scenario table
Old: No time dimension. Rows were just price levels.
New: First column is a rough timeline (< 1yr, 2-3yr, 5yr+). Reader immediately understands *when* each scenario could happen, not just *what*.

### 2. Asymmetric framing (dollar loss / multiple gain)
Old: Downside was −60%, −35%. Upside was dollar amounts ($300K, $500K).
New: Downside is dollar losses (lose $60K, lose $35K). Upside is multiples (3x, 5x, 10x).
Why: Losses are pain denominated in dollars ("how much do I lose?"). Gains are excitement denominated in multiples ("how much do I make?"). Different cognitive modes for different directions — lower total cognitive load.

### 3. BELIEF line as insight claim
Old: Logic flowchart (`ai overbuild → compute glut → quantum inherits infra → PQC via NIST`).
New: The bet stated plainly ("The AI buildout has a beneficiary nobody's pricing: mandated post-quantum hardware.").
Why: The reader needs to know what they're betting on, not the derivation path. DEEPER CLAIM already explains the reasoning chain.

### 4. Company intro with temporal beat
Old: "There's a $688M Swiss chip company making the exact hardware that NIST requires..."
New: "There's a $688M Swiss chip company that spent two years building PQC hardware before anyone wanted it — and hit production the year NIST made it mandatory..."
Why: Timing risk posture in one sentence. They're not vaporware hoping for a mandate. They built the thing, then the mandate showed up.

### 5. Floor statement before scenario table
Old: "If SEALSQ captures even 5%, it re-rates to the size of existing quantum companies."
New: "The number that matters: $688M market cap for the only production-ready play on a market going from $0.4B to $2.8B. At current price, the market is pricing zero mandate adoption. That's the floor. Every government contract above zero is upside:"
Why: Frames how you read the numbers. Downside rows become "even below the floor." Upside rows become "any adoption above zero."

### 6. REJECTED framing line
Old: Bare list of rejected tickers.
New: "Every obvious quantum play has the same problem — priced for the narrative, not the mandate:" before the list.
Why: Turns the rejection table into evidence for the winning trade.

### 7. KILLS with time column
Old: Bullet list with no time dimension.
New: Each kill has a time column (2026, 2027+, anytime, policy). `Next:` replaces `Watch:` for urgency.

### 8. Table header simplified
Old: `── $100K at $3.85 ($688M) ─────`
New: `── $100K in LAES at $3.85 ─────`
Why: MC is already in the company intro. Don't repeat. Ticker in the header is more useful for quick reference.

### 9. Summary line includes trade horizon
Old: `25,974 sh · no expiry · >35% +EV`
New: `25,974 sh · 2-3yr horizon · >35% +EV`

BELIEF
The AI buildout has a beneficiary nobody's
pricing: mandated post-quantum hardware.
────────────────────────────────────

There's a $688M Swiss chip company that spent
two years building PQC hardware before anyone
wanted it — and hit production the year NIST
made it mandatory for every US government system.

SEALSQ (LAES) · $3.85 · LONG

────────────────────────────────────

WHY

NIST published three PQC standards in 2024.
NSA's first hard deadline is 2026 — networking
hardware must support quantum-resistant crypto.
Full migration required by 2035. No opt-out.

SEALSQ's QS7001 is a hardware-embedded PQC
chip targeting mass production 2026. $220M
cash, $17.5M revenue. Purest public PQC play.

The number that matters: $688M market cap for
the only production-ready play on a market
going from $0.4B to $2.8B. At current price,
the market is pricing zero mandate adoption.
That's the floor. Every government contract
above zero is upside:

── $100K in LAES at $3.85 ─────

 <1yr    lose $60K   thesis breaks
 <1yr    lose $35K   adoption stalls
 2-3yr       3x      → QUBT-size
 3-5yr       5x      → RGTI-size
 5yr+       10x      → D-Wave-size

QUBT  $2.1B  Quantum Computing Inc
RGTI  $3.4B  Rigetti Computing
QBTS  $6.9B  D-Wave Quantum

25,974 sh · 2-3yr horizon · >35% +EV

────────────────────────────────────

KILLS

· 2026    QS7001 misses mass production
· 2027+   NXP/STM/MCHP ship competing PQC
· anytime quantum basket selloff drags LAES
· policy  NIST delays or softens mandate

Next: QS7001 production (2026) · SEALSQ Q1

────────────────────────────────────

REJECTED

Every obvious quantum play has the same
problem — priced for the narrative, not
the mandate:

IONQ calls  96% IV, 74% to breakeven
IGV puts    down 14-21% YTD already
QBTS        $7.3B on $30M rev, priced in
RGTI calls  93% IV, same theta bleed
SQQQ        low thesis β, 75%/yr decay
HL perps    5x max, <$15M OI

────────────────────────────────────

DEEPER CLAIM

Your thesis chains 4 steps: overbuild
→ glut → fire sale → quantum benefits.
Each step can fail or mistime.

The PQC angle needs one step: the mandate
is published, the deadline is set. NIST
doesn't need AI to overbuild. Just the
calendar moving toward 2030.

AI overbuild makes this thesis stronger
(cheap infra for quantum), but the trade
doesn't need it. The mandate is the floor.
Everything else is upside.

────────────────────────────────────

ALT
IONQ Jan 2028 $50 calls — higher
ceiling ($500K+), higher floor ($0).
Different risk: leverage + time decay.

EXECUTE
Robinhood → LAES → Buy → Shares
→ $100,000 → Limit order (wide spreads)
