# Output Draft v6 — Minto + Price + Comparables

## Design principles applied
- Minto Pyramid: answer is self-contained, no Googling needed
- Every section meets reader at their current understanding
- Reader journey: belief → what company → why → what happens → details
- Comparables as upside labels, loss % as downside labels
- Price included for "am I winning?" brokerage checks
- MC as proof, comparable as meaning

BELIEF
ai overbuild → compute glut →
quantum inherits infra → PQC via NIST
────────────────────────────────────

There's a $688M Swiss chip company making
the exact hardware that NIST requires every
US government system to adopt by 2035.

SEALSQ (LAES) · $3.85 · LONG

────────────────────────────────────

WHY

NIST published three PQC standards in 2024.
NSA's first hard deadline is 2026 — networking
hardware must support quantum-resistant crypto.
Full migration required by 2035. No opt-out.

SEALSQ's QS7001 is a hardware-embedded PQC
chip targeting mass production 2026. $220M
cash, $17.5M revenue. Purest public PQC play.

PQC market: $0.4B today → $2.8B by 2030.
If SEALSQ captures even 5%, it re-rates to
the size of existing public quantum companies:

── $100K at $3.85 ($688M) ─────

 −60%    $1.54     $40K   $275M
 −35%    $2.50     $65K   $447M
→ QUBT  $11.55    $300K   $2.1B
→ RGTI  $19.25    $500K   $3.4B
→ QBTS  $38.50      $1M   $6.9B

QUBT = Quantum Computing Inc ($1.8B)
RGTI = Rigetti Computing ($5.3B)
QBTS = D-Wave Quantum ($7.3B)

25,974 sh · no expiry · >35% +EV

────────────────────────────────────

KILLS

· NIST delays past 2035
· QS7001 misses 2026 production
· NXP/STM/MCHP commoditize PQC
· Quantum basket selloff drags LAES

REJECTED

IONQ calls  96% IV, 74% to breakeven
IGV puts    down 14-21% YTD already
QBTS        $7.3B on $30M, priced in
RGTI calls  93% IV, same theta bleed
SQQQ        low thesis β, 75%/yr decay
HL perps    5x max, <$15M OI

────────────────────────────────────

DEEPER CLAIM

Your thesis chains 4 steps: overbuild
→ glut → fire sale → quantum benefits.
Each step can fail or mistime.

The PQC angle needs one step: the mandate
is published, the deadline is set. NIST
doesn't need AI to overbuild. Just the
calendar moving toward 2030.

AI overbuild makes this thesis stronger
(cheap infra for quantum), but the trade
doesn't need it. The mandate is the floor.
Everything else is upside.

────────────────────────────────────

ALT
IONQ Jan 2028 $50 calls — higher
ceiling ($500K+), higher floor ($0).
Different risk: leverage + time decay.

EXECUTE
Robinhood → LAES → Buy → Shares
→ $100,000 → Limit order (wide spreads)

## What changed from v5

### 1. The company is introduced before the ticker
Old: `LAES (SEALSQ) LONG — $688M MC`
New: "There's a $688M Swiss chip company making the exact hardware that NIST requires every US government system to adopt by 2035."

The reader now knows WHAT they're buying before they see the ticker. No Googling. The ticker line becomes confirmation, not introduction.

### 2. WHY section flows into the scenarios
Old: One-liner thesis → jump to $100K table
New: WHY explains NIST → NSA deadline → SEALSQ's chip → market size → "if they capture 5%, they re-rate to..." → scenarios

The scenarios are now the CONCLUSION of the WHY section, not a disconnected data table. The reader builds understanding progressively:
- NIST published standards (fact)
- NSA deadline is 2026 (urgency)
- SEALSQ makes the chip (connection)
- Market is $0.4B → $2.8B (scale)
- 5% share = re-rates to quantum company size (the "aha")
- Here's what that looks like for your $100K (payoff)

### 3. Comparable legend below the table
QUBT, RGTI, QBTS mean nothing to most readers. One line each:
```
QUBT = Quantum Computing Inc ($1.8B)
RGTI = Rigetti Computing ($5.3B)
QBTS = D-Wave Quantum ($7.3B)
```
Now the reader understands the milestone without leaving.

### 4. Downside = loss %, Upside = company milestone
The labels match how traders actually think:
- Losing: "how much am I down?" → −60%, −35%
- Winning: "what size is it now?" → QUBT, RGTI, D-Wave

### 5. Reader journey follows Minto
```
Belief (you said this)
  → Answer (here's a company that fits)
    → Why (here's the mandate + the math)
      → Scenarios (here's what happens to your money)
        → Risks (here's what kills it)
          → Alternatives (here's what else we considered)
            → Execute (here's how to do it)
```

Each section only requires understanding from the sections above it.
Nothing requires Googling. Nothing requires prior knowledge.
