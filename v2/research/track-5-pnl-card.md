# Track 5: The PnL Card as Viral Unit

## Research Summary

Deep analysis of what makes financial content shareable, drawn from Robinhood screenshot culture, r/wallstreetbets, prediction markets, Spotify Wrapped, and FinTwit. The goal: define a PnL card spec that maximizes organic sharing.

---

## 1. Robinhood Screenshot Culture

### What the Screenshots Show
The iconic Robinhood P&L screenshot has become the meme lingua franca of retail finance. The standard screenshot contains:

- **Portfolio value** (large number, top of screen)
- **Dollar gain/loss** and **percentage return** (prominently displayed)
- **Time-series chart** — the signature green (gain) or red (loss) line
- **Time range selector** (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y, ALL)
- **Position list** below the chart (ticker, shares, current value, return)

### What People Crop vs Keep
Users typically screenshot the **top portion only**: the big number, the percentage, and the chart. They crop out:
- The bottom navigation bar
- Individual positions (unless showing a specific YOLO)
- Account details / buying power

The viral unit is: **Big number + green/red line + percentage**. That's it. The simpler the screenshot, the more it spreads.

### Why It Goes Viral
- **Instant legibility**: You understand it in under 1 second
- **Emotional polarity**: Extreme green = envy/FOMO; extreme red = schadenfreude/solidarity
- **Authenticity signal**: A raw screenshot from a real brokerage feels trustworthy
- **Universal format**: Everyone who's used Robinhood recognizes it immediately

### Robinhood Recap (Wrapped-style Feature)
Robinhood launched "Robinhood Recap" (2020) — a year-end review showing personalized cards:
- New member status ("You were among 3M+ who joined this year")
- Most-watched sectors
- Dividend income earned
- Community stats (most-invested sector, watchlist additions)
- Animated GIF cards for each data point
- Users shared via screenshot/screen-record with #MyRobinhoodRecap

**Key insight**: Robinhood's own sharing feature was an afterthought — users had already turned raw screenshots into a viral format organically. The best shareable formats emerge from user behavior, not product design.

## 2. r/wallstreetbets Gain/Loss Porn

### Format Requirements
WSB has evolved strict norms for gain/loss posts:
- **Must include positions** — not just the P&L number, but what you held
- **Minimum stakes**: $10,000 in options or $25,000 in equity at risk
- **Screenshot from a real broker** (Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, etc.)
- **Flairs**: Gain, Loss, YOLO (high-risk bets)

### What Drives Engagement
1. **Magnitude**: The bigger the number (gain OR loss), the more engagement. $700K loss posts get tens of thousands of upvotes.
2. **Audacity**: YOLO posts (all-in on a single trade) get respect regardless of outcome
3. **Narrative**: The best posts include a backstory — "I bet my savings on GME calls" — not just a number
4. **Positions or ban**: The community enforces proof. No positions = no credibility.
5. **Emotional catharsis**: Loss porn functions as group therapy. Gains trigger FOMO.

### Engagement Hierarchy (most viral to least)
1. Massive loss with positions shown (schadenfreude + "at least it's not me")
2. Massive gain with YOLO context (FOMO + "it actually worked")
3. Gain/loss with thesis context ("I said X would happen and it did/didn't")
4. Simple P&L screenshot without context (lowest engagement)

**Key insight**: The THESIS matters as much as the P&L. "I made $200K" is interesting. "I said NVDA would 5x because of AI inference demand and bet $40K on calls — here's the result" is viral.

---

## 3. Polymarket / Kalshi Social Features

### Polymarket
- **X/Twitter partnership**: Polymarket became X's official prediction market partner. Market data appears as annotations on tweets, with Grok-powered explanations.
- **Market cards**: Clean, modern UI with adaptive card layouts for binary, categorical, and multi-market types. Interactive price history charts with probability percentages.
- **Share mechanism**: Users mostly screenshot the probability chart + market title. There's no dedicated "share card" — users just screenshot.
- **Third-party tools**: PolyPulse shows Polymarket odds directly on tweets. There's even a "Fake Polymarket Screenshot Generator" — proving the format has become a meme.
- **Visual language**: Color-coded probability, clean typography, dark/light modes.

### Kalshi
- **Sports-card-style announcements**: Both Polymarket and Kalshi use parody versions of ESPN/FOX Sports announcement cards with jokey headlines for social media marketing.
- **Integration focus**: Built for engagement within the social feed, not separate sharing.

**Key insight**: Prediction markets went viral through **embedding in the social feed** (appearing on tweets), not through standalone share cards. The most effective format is one that looks native to the platform it's shared on.

## 4. Trading Card Aesthetics vs. Minimal/Clean

### The Crypto Trading Card Approach
- NFT trading cards use the collectible card format (name, stats, rarity, artwork)
- Cardsmiths created physical "Currency Cards" with embedded crypto
- These appeal to collectors but haven't achieved mainstream viral sharing

### The Fintech Minimal Approach
- Neobank cards use bold signature colors (Nubank purple, N26 aqua, Wise green)
- Dark backgrounds with clean typography dominate modern fintech
- Data visualization is simple: lines, dots, typography — not ornate

### Verdict
**Minimal/clean wins for virality**. Trading card aesthetics work for collectibles and communities that already buy in, but they add friction for casual sharing. The Robinhood screenshot succeeded precisely because it was NOT designed — it was a raw, authentic capture. The right aesthetic is:
- Dark background (reads well on Twitter dark mode, iMessage, etc.)
- Bold typography for the key number
- One accent color (green for gains, red for loss)
- Minimal chrome / no decoration
- Looks like it could be a screenshot from a real product

## 5. FinTwit Viral Trade Posts

### What Makes Financial Content Go Viral on Twitter/X

**The "I Called It" Format**:
The most viral financial content on Twitter follows this pattern:
1. Original thesis tweet (timestamped)
2. Outcome screenshot (P&L or price chart)
3. Quote-tweet combining both: "I said this. Here's what happened."

This works because it combines:
- **Conviction signal** — "I had the thesis before the crowd"
- **Proof of outcome** — "And I was right"
- **Social proof** — "My analysis works"

**Engagement Drivers**:
- Short, punchy format — succinct sentences have highest virality
- Explaining complex subjects simply
- Humor and personality (sarcasm, self-deprecation)
- The "$" cashtag creates discoverability and authority
- Screenshots of gains trigger FOMO; screenshots of losses trigger solidarity

**The Emotional Core**:
The emotional driver of viral trade posts is **identity**. People share trades that say something about who they are:
- "I'm smart enough to see this before others" (conviction)
- "I'm brave enough to bet big" (audacity)
- "I'm honest about my losses" (authenticity)
- "I have a thesis, not just a trade" (intellectual identity)

**Key insight**: The thesis IS the viral unit, not the P&L. The PnL validates the thesis. Our card should lead with the belief/thesis and use the trade expression as proof of conviction.

## 6. Shareable Artifacts from Other Domains

### Spotify Wrapped — The Gold Standard
**Why it works (behavioral science)**:
1. **Quantitative Fixation** — Precise numbers transform behavior into identity ("You listened to 47,392 minutes of music")
2. **Social Comparison** — Rankings enable self-positioning ("Top 1% of Taylor Swift listeners")
3. **Identity Signaling** — Satisfies dual need for belonging (cultural moment) and uniqueness (personal stats)
4. **Nostalgia** — Songs become emotional time capsules
5. **Low-friction sharing** — Pre-designed cards that look good on every platform

**Design specs**:
- Animated slides with bold typography and gradients
- Story-format vertical cards (9:16 for Instagram Stories)
- One data point per card (clarity > density)
- Brand colors + personalized accent colors
- One-tap share to Instagram Stories, Twitter, etc.
- Subtle branding (attribution without feeling like an ad)

**Critical principle**: "Wrapped never says 'Look how great we are.' It says 'Look how interesting YOU are.'" People share because the card reflects their identity, not the product's features.

### Strava Year in Sport
- Personalized data cards from activity logs
- Infographics built from simple elements: lines, dots, color strips, typography
- Customizable "Totals card" (cumulative or sport-specific stats, optional profile photo)
- Share to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, messaging apps
- Video + static versions available
- Chapters structure (storytelling through data)

### GitHub Contribution Graph / Skyline
- The green contribution grid became a developer identity marker
- GitHub Skyline turns it into a 3D model (shareable, 3D-printable)
- Won DevRel Awards' Best Developer Marketing Campaign (2022)
- Key: transforms mundane data (commits) into visual identity

### Duolingo Streaks
- Streak numbers become shareable identity badges
- Gamification mechanics (loss aversion drives streak maintenance)
- Character illustrations add personality
- Simple: one number (streak count) + character = shareable unit

### Common Patterns Across All
| Pattern | Spotify | Strava | GitHub | Duolingo |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| One hero metric | Minutes | Distance | Contributions | Streak |
| Identity framing | "You are a..." | "You're an athlete" | "You shipped" | "You're dedicated" |
| Comparison hook | "Top X%" | vs. last year | vs. community | vs. friends |
| Visual simplicity | 1 stat/card | clean infographic | green grid | number + owl |
| Platform-native sizing | Story format | Story + feed | Image | Story |
| Brand subtlety | Logo only | Logo only | Octocat | Duo character |

## 7. PnL Card Spec: Recommended Design

### Core Philosophy
**"Look how sharp YOUR thesis was"** — not "look at our product."

The card should make the user look smart, bold, and interesting. The Belief Router is invisible; the user's conviction is the star.

### Information Hierarchy (What to Include)

**Must Have (Above the Fold)**:
1. **The Thesis** — Natural language belief statement in quotation marks (e.g., "ETH will flip SOL on L2 revenue by Q3")
2. **Conviction Timestamp** — When the belief was expressed (creates "I called it" proof)
3. **Trade Expression(s)** — The specific position(s) the router suggested (e.g., "Long ETH/SOL perp @ 2.3x on Hyperliquid")
4. **P&L Result** — Dollar amount and percentage return, large and bold
5. **Outcome Status** — Active / Closed / Expired with visual indicator

**Should Have (Below the Fold / Secondary)**:
6. **Platform Badge(s)** — Which exchange(s) the trade executes on (Derive, Hyperliquid, Polymarket, Aevo) — small icons
7. **Risk Tier** — Visual indicator of position sizing (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive)
8. **Time Horizon** — How long the thesis played out

**Must NOT Have**:
- Account balances or total portfolio value (privacy)
- Wallet addresses or account identifiers
- Other positions or portfolio context
- Complex multi-leg strategy details (simplify to outcome)
- Fine print or disclaimers on the card itself (link out if needed)

### Why This Hierarchy Works
- **Thesis first**: This is what makes it unique vs. any P&L screenshot. The BELIEF is the viral unit.
- **Timestamp**: Creates "I called it" provability. Enables the most viral FinTwit pattern.
- **Trade expression**: Shows this isn't just talk — there was a real trade behind the belief.
- **P&L**: Validates everything above. The emotional payoff.
- **No account details**: Privacy-safe sharing. Users will share more if they don't expose their portfolio.

### Dimensions & Format

**Primary: Twitter/X Card (1200 x 675px)**
- Aspect ratio: 1.91:1
- This is the most important format — Twitter is where financial content goes viral
- Works as og:image for link sharing AND as a standalone image
- Safe zone: keep critical content centered, avoid edges

**Secondary: Instagram Story (1080 x 1920px)**
- Aspect ratio: 9:16
- Keep important content 250px from top/bottom edges (UI safe zone)
- Good for crypto/degen audience on Instagram
- Vertical layout: thesis at top, chart in middle, P&L at bottom

**Tertiary: iMessage Preview (1200 x 1200px)**
- Square format works best for iMessage link previews
- Main content should fit within 1200 x 630 center zone (for cross-platform compat)
- iMessage only uses og:title + og:image (keep title under 44 chars)
- Minimum: 2400 x 1256 for iOS 16+ (just double the standard 1200x628)

**Export Options**:
- PNG (static, universal)
- Animated (for platforms that support it — adds subtle motion like a price line drawing)
- Copy-to-clipboard (one tap)
- Direct share to Twitter, Instagram, iMessage, Telegram, Discord

### Visual Design Direction

**Color System**:
- Background: Dark (#0D0D0D or similar near-black) — reads well everywhere, feels premium
- Gain accent: Electric green (#00FF88 or similar) — not Robinhood's exact green, but the same emotional register
- Loss accent: Vivid red (#FF3366) — honest, not hidden
- Text: White primary, gray secondary (#888)
- Brand: Very subtle — small logo or wordmark in corner, never dominant

**Typography**:
- P&L number: Extra bold, 48-72pt equivalent (the hero)
- Thesis text: Medium weight, 18-24pt, in quotation marks (the story)
- Metadata (timestamp, platform, etc.): Light weight, 12-14pt (the proof)

### Viral Loop Mechanics

1. **One-tap generation**: After a trade resolves, the card auto-generates. User doesn't build it.
2. **One-tap share**: Share button opens native share sheet (Twitter, Instagram, iMessage, copy link)
3. **Link-back URL**: Card includes a URL that shows the full thesis + trade detail page (drives traffic back)
4. **Social proof accumulation**: User profile shows all past thesis cards (creating a track record)
5. **"Prove it" mechanic**: The timestamp + platform + P&L creates an unforgeable proof of conviction

### Viral Coefficient Optimization

Based on research on viral loop design:

- **Trigger**: Trade resolves (automatic card generation prompt)
- **Value delivery**: User gets a beautiful, identity-affirming artifact ("look how right I was")
- **User acquisition**: Viewer sees the card, thinks "I want to express MY thesis too" -> clicks link -> enters Belief Router
- **Minimize viral cycle time**: Auto-generate card the moment a trade closes. Don't make users wait or build anything.
- **Identity over utility**: The card should make the sharer look smart/bold, not advertise the product

## 8. Reference Examples: 5 Formats to Draw From

### 1. Robinhood P&L Screenshot (The OG)
- **What to steal**: The big green/red number + percentage + simple line chart. Instant legibility.
- **What to improve**: Add the THESIS. Robinhood shows what happened but not why the user believed it would happen. That's our differentiator.

### 2. WSB YOLO Post Format
- **What to steal**: Positions shown (proves it's real), minimum stake requirement (signals conviction), the "DD" (due diligence) backstory.
- **What to improve**: Distill the DD into one thesis sentence. WSB posts are walls of text — our card is the tweet-length version.

### 3. Spotify Wrapped Card
- **What to steal**: One hero metric per card, identity framing ("You're a Top 1% listener" -> "You called ETH's reversal before 99% of traders"), pre-designed shareable format, subtle branding.
- **What to improve**: Wrapped is annual; our cards are per-trade. Higher frequency = more viral surface area.

### 4. Polymarket Probability Chart
- **What to steal**: Clean dark UI, probability visualization, the concept of embedding in the social feed rather than forcing users to leave.
- **What to improve**: Polymarket shows market consensus. Our card shows individual conviction vs. outcome. It's personal, not aggregate.

### 5. The "I Called It" Quote Tweet
- **What to steal**: The original thesis (timestamped) + outcome proof pattern. This is the most viral financial content format on Twitter.
- **What to improve**: Automate what people do manually. Instead of screenshotting an old tweet and combining it with a P&L screenshot, our card does this in one artifact.

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't show account balances** — Privacy kills sharing. Show return %, not portfolio size.
2. **Don't make it look like an ad** — Subtle branding only. If it looks like marketing, nobody shares it.
3. **Don't require manual creation** — Auto-generate. Every friction point halves sharing rate.
4. **Don't overcrowd the card** — One thesis, one trade, one result. Complexity kills virality.
5. **Don't use complex financial jargon** — "Long ETH/SOL perp" is fine. "Synthetic delta-neutral basis trade with 3-leg options structure" is not.
6. **Don't hide losses** — Loss cards should be just as shareable as gain cards. WSB proves losses drive MORE engagement than gains.
7. **Don't fake authenticity** — The card should feel like a real product screenshot, not a marketing graphic.
