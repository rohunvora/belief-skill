# SCORES.md — Test Harness Score Log

Track progression of test harness scores. Each entry is a run.

## Runs

- **47/48 passing** | avg 94/100
- INVALID: Used seeded cache (pre-populated search results) — same as theme-map cheating
- Cache deleted, seed script deleted

### Run 2 — 2026-02-15 ~03:30 EST (pending — Brave API exhausted)
- Cannot run: Brave Search API at 2001/2000 monthly quota
- Changes made: deleted theme-map.json, added ETF classification, added thesis-based short detection
- Waiting for API budget to test
